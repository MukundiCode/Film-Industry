# Film-Industry
A platform for easy registration and check in for actors set to be on set on a film site.
1. Make sure you have python installed on your computer , and make sure pip is working. Test it by 'pip freeze', it should
show the python libraries installed on your pc
2. Install django by 'pip install django'
3. Change directory to the /FilmIndustry, in your command line.
4. Start the server by running this command in your cmd, 'python manage.py runserver'
5. Copy the address and paste it in your browser. 

Testing
1. address/register creates a new account, logs you in and allows you to create your profile
2. address/login logs you in, but I am yet to route it to the profile page, but you can test the profile page by address/profile, given that
someone is logged in
